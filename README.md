## Imogen Kraak

A hardworking, self-motivated professional with a background in design, account management, and product development.

I spent four months teaching myself software development before completing a 16-week Software Engineering course at Makers Academy, I am now looking for a role where I can build effective and engaging products.

Prior to completing the Makers course, I was a Commercial Relations Manager and Designer at a small start-up where I worked with large clients such as Guinness, Jack Daniels, and Brewdog to run brand activations in our partner venues across the UK. Before that, I worked at an experiential marketing company creating animations to be used for projections and VR. During both jobs, I learned how to create large scale experiences with limited resources and people.

I’m inspired by emerging technologies, and after understanding them from a design point of view, I wanted to delve further and began to teach myself to code. I am now looking to continue to grow these skills and start my career as a developer.
