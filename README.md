## Imogen Kraak

After years of working on the app management and design side of the startup industry and feeling inspired by a range of beautifully designed and developed apps, I left my job to pursue software engineering full time. I taught myself Swift and I'm currently completing a 12-week Software Engineering Bootcamp at Makers Academy.
